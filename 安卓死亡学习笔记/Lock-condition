condition 
lock has different condition.
	'cause the instance has many different conditions.
	 so ,we may see

Lock lock = new Lock;
Condition firstCondition = lock.new Condition();
Condition secondCondition = lock.new Condition();	
.
.
.
{
	firstCondition.await();
	.
	.
	.
	secondCondition.singal();
}
