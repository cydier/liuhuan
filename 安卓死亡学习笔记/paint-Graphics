Grphics
if you wanna use the paint method to paint,you need:
		u should be using some Frame or panel(I think)
		u should have the Graphics paremeters in the paint method
		donot need to call the paint method
		so,we may see:

new MyFrame();
.
.
.
Class MyFrame extends JFrame{
.
.
.
	public void paint(graphics  g){}
}


and you can repaint
	component.paint(component.getGraphics())
